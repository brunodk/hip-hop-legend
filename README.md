# Hip-Hop Legend

This project is based on the first challenge of [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). It uses the audio API from HTML5 with vanilla JavaScript to play sounds and beats of Hip-Hop.

Select a sound to play the beats among the loop, or play freely. In the future, if I still have willpower, there will be the option to upload your own loop.

Beware. For some, this can be addictive ðŸ”¥.
